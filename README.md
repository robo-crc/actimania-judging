Actimania 2015 Judging Application
=================

This is an updated version of Actimania-Judging.

# What is this?
Running out of time to work on [Arbitr](https://github.com/michaelsanford/Arbitr) before [Actimania 2015](http://www.robo-crc.ca/en/category/nemolition-2014/), I have opted to deploy an improved version of the [Velistic judging](https://github.com/robo-crc/velistic-judging) application this year.

I will continue development on Arbitr for upcoming competitions, and will update this README with more documentation on getting it running if you want to play with it.

## Installation
The only pre-requisite is [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robo-crc/actimania-judging.git
cd actimania-judging
vagrant up
```

Then go play with it at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
