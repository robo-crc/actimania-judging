Nemolition 2014 Judging Application
=================

# What is this?
Running out of time to work on [Arbitr](https://github.com/michaelsanford/Arbitr) before [Nemolition 2014](http://www.robo-crc.ca/en/category/nemolition-2014/), I have opted to deploy an improved version of the [Velistic judging](https://github.com/robo-crc/velistic-judging) application this year.

I will continue development on Arbitr for upcoming competitions, and will update this README with more documentation on getting it running if you want to play with it.

## Installation
The only pre-requisite is [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), then:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:robo-crc/nemoliton-judging.git
cd nemoliton-judging
vagrant up
```

Then go play with it at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
